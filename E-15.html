                        Now, he's a teenage boy called Lester. Apollo has angered his father Zeus for the last time. So,
                        how do you punish an immortal? By making him human. Obviously. Cast down from Olympus, he's
                        weak, disorientated and stuck in New York City as a teenage boy. It's the first time he's been
                        without his powers, and he has to survive in the modern world. Which isn't an easy feat for a
                        four-thousand-year old deity, especially one with as many enemies as he has. Apollo needs help,
                        and he can only think of one place to go . . . an enclave of modern demigods known as Camp
                        Half-Blood.</p><br>

                        now he's an awkward teenager. Things aren't going well for Apollo. There's only one way he can
                        earn back Zeus' favour, and that's to seek and restore the ancient oracles - but that's easier
                        said than done. Apollo must head to the American Midwest where, rumour has it, a haunted cave
                        may hold answers. There are a few things standing in his way though. The cave could kill him, or
                        drive him insane. Oh, and a Roman Emperor, whose love of bloodshed makes Nero look tame. To stay
                        alive, Apollo needs the help of a mortal goddess, a bronze dragon, and some familiar faces from
                        Camp Half-Blood. Will he survive the greatest challenge of his four thousand year existence?</p>

                        was cast out his father, Zeus. Now, he's an awkward teenager. Called Lester. The only way out is
                        a series of scary and dangerous trials, of course. For his third trial, Apollo must journey
                        through the Labyrinth to free an Oracle who only speaks in puzzles. Then, defeat the most
                        vicious of three very vicious Roman Emperors. (All without the use of his godly powers.) It
                        looks like he will need all the help he can get - from some new and old friends.</p><br>

                        very fast, for Apollo . . . The former God Apollo is having a pretty rough time of it. Well, for
                        one thing, he's been turned into a human and banished from Olympus. And he's called Lester. But
                        being an awkward mortal teenager is the least of his worries right now. Though he and some of
                        his friends have emerged from the Burning Maze, rescued the Oracle and lived to fight another
                        day, they can't escape the tragedy that has befallen them, or the terrible trials still to face.
                        So, with heavy heart, Apollo (OK, Lester) and Meg have a triumvirate still to defeat, oracles to
                        rescue, and prophecies to decipher,</p><br>

                        is over. New Rome is safe. Tarquin and his army of the undead have been defeated. Somehow Apollo
                        has made it out alive, with a little bit of help from the Hunters of Artemis. But though the
                        battle may have been won, the war is far from over. Now Apollo and Meg must get ready for the
                        final - and, let's face it, probably fatal - adventure. They must face the last emperor, the
                        terrifying Nero, and destroy him once and for all. Can Apollo find his godly form again? Will
                        Meg be able to face up to her troubled past?</p><br>
