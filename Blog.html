                    <p>Authors Attic | Virtual Library is a completely free, online library suitable for ages 6-15. It includes a variety of books, containing not only both fiction and nonfiction books, but also books in three languages- English, Hindi and Sanskrit.</p>
                    <br>

The team realised during the course of the pandemic that there are several children all around India that do not get the opportunity to read books for several reasons and therefore decided to take the initiative to make the library. They combined skills they had picked up like coding, organisation and team work, excel and more and came together to create this library. The faced many hurdles, including disagreements, technical issues, miscommunication and more but in the end cme together to launch the library. What started as a fun project lead to something they launched publicly on the internet.</p>
