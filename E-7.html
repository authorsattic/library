                        about Christmas, I could squeak! My favorite nephew Benjamin was going to come over, and we were
                        planning to trim the tree and eat lots of delicious holiday Cheesy Chews. But before you could
                        say 'cat alert,' disaster struck! I slipped over my tail and ended up in the hospital. And then
                        my mouse hole caught on fire! Holey cheese, this was turning out to be the worst Christmas
                        ever....</p><br>

                        every mouse's worst nightmare! My old friend Creepella von Cacklefur called me one night and
                        ordered me to join her for the weekend at her family's spooky castle. And before I could say
                        'boo!' she'd mouse-napped me! Now I was stuck in the gloomiest, eeriest castle I'd ever seen.
                        Even worse, I was surrounded by Creepella's creepy family! Oh, would I ever escape back to my
                        safe, cozy mouse hole in New Mouse City?'</p><br>
