                        Lewis gradually went from being an atheist to a committed Anglican—famously converting to
                        Christianity in 1931 after conversing into the night with his friends J. R. R. Tolkien and Hugh
                        Dyson—and how Lewis delivered his wartime talks to a traumatized British nation in the midst of
                        an all-out war for survival. Marsden recounts how versions of those talks were collected
                        together in 1952 under the title Mere Chr...</p><br>

                        classical antiquity are more famous--yet more poorly understood--than Cleopatra VII, queen of
                        Egypt. In this major biography, Duane Roller reveals that Cleopatra was in fact a learned and
                        visionary leader whose overarching goal was always the preservation of her dynasty and kingdom.
                        Roller's authoritative account is the first to be based solely on primary materials from the
                        Greco-Roman period: literary sources, Egyptian documents (Cleopatra's own writings), and
                        representations in art and coinage produced while she was alive. His compelling portrait of the
                        queen illuminates her prowess as a royal administrator who managed a large and diverse kingdom
                        extending from Asia Minor to the interior of Egypt, as a naval commander who led her own fleet
                        in battle</p><br>

                        account, Julian Young provides the most comprehensive biography available today of the life and
                        philosophy of the nineteenth-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Young deals with
                        the many puzzles created by the conjunction of Nietzsche's personal history and his work: why
                        the son of a Lutheran pastor developed into the self-styled 'Antichrist'; why this archetypical
                        Prussian came to loath Bismarck's Prussia; and why this enemy of feminism preferred the company
                        of feminist women. Setting Nietzsche's thought in the context of his times - the rise of
                        Prussian militarism, anti-Semitism, Darwinian science, the 'Youth' and emancipationist
                        movements, as well as the 'death of God' - Young emphasises the decisive influence of Plato and
                        of Richard Wagner on Nietzsche's attempted reform of Western culture </p><br>

                        close to an autobiography by Alfred Hitchcock that you could ever have. Drawn from years of
                        interviews with her subject, his friends and the actors who worked with him on such classics as
                        THE BIRDS, PSYCHO and REAR VIEW WINDOW, Charlotte Chandler has created a rich, complex,
                        affectionate and honest picture of the man and his milieu. This is Hitchcock in his own voice

                        scientist more famous than Marie Curie (1867-1934). She made one of the most important
                        theoretical breakthroughs of the twentieth century when she postulated that radiation was an
                        atomic rather than a chemical property, an important milestone in understanding the structure of
                        matter. Not only did she coin the term radioactivity, but her painstaking research culminated in
                        the isolation of two new elements, polonium and radium. For her achievements she won two Nobel
                        Prizes, one in physics (in 1903) and the other in chemistry (in 1911). This informative,
                        accessible, and concise biography looks at Marie Curie not just as a dedicated scientist but
                        also as a complex woman with a sometimes-tumultuous personal life.</p><br>

                        character and achievements have always divided critics and commentators. In this compelling
                        biography, Frank McLynn draws on the most recent scholarship and throws a brilliant light on
                        this most paradoxical of men--as military leader, lover, and emperor. Tracing Napoleon's
                        extraordinary career, McLynn examines the Promethean legend from his Corsican roots, through the
                        years of the French Revolution and his military triumphs, to his coronation in 1804 and ultimate
                        defeat and imprisonment. McLynn brilliantly reveals the extent to which Napoleon was both
                        existential hero and plaything of Fate; mathematician and mystic; intellectual giant and moral
                        pygmy; great man and deeply flawed human being.</p><br>

                    <p class="books-description" style="height: 166px; overflow-y: scroll;">Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980)
                        was one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century. Regarded as the father of
                        existentialist philosophy, he was also a political critic, moralist, playwright, novelist, and
                        author of biographies and short stories. Thomas R. Flynn provides the first book-length account
                        of Sartre as a philosopher of the imaginary, mapping the intellectual development of his ideas
                        throughout his life, and building a narrative that is not only philosophical but also attentive
                        to the political and literary dimensions of his work. Exploring Sartre's existentialism,
                        politics, ethics, and ontology, this book illuminates the defining ideas of Sartre's oeuvre: the
                        literary and the philosophical, the imaginary and the conceptual, his descriptive phenomenology
                        and his phenomenological concept of intentionality, and his conjunction of ethics and politics
                        with an 'egoless' consciousness. It will appeal to all who are interested in Sartre's philosophy
                        and its relation to his life</p><br>

                    <p class="books-description" style="height: 166px; overflow-y: scroll;">The Bhagavad Gita, perhaps
                        the most famous of all Indian scriptures, is universally regarded as one of the world's
                        spiritual and literary masterpieces. Richard Davis tells the story of this venerable and
                        enduring book, from its origins in ancient India to its reception today as a spiritual classic
                        that has been translated into more than seventy-five languages. The Gita opens on the eve of a
                        mighty battle, when the warrior Arjuna is overwhelmed by despair and refuses to fight. He turns
                        to his charioteer, Krishna, who counsels him on why he must. In the dialogue that follows,
                        Arjuna comes to realize that the true battle is for his own soul.</p><br>

                        the book of Genesis has been the keystone to almost every important claim about reality,
                        humanity, and God in Judaism and Christianity. And it continues to play a central role in
                        debates about science, politics, and human rights. With clarity and skill, acclaimed biblical
                        scholar Ronald Hendel provides a panoramic history of this iconic book, exploring its impact on
                        Western religion, philosophy, science, politics, literature, and more.</p><br>

                        Thomas Aquinas, which holds a unique place in Western religion and philosophy. Written between
                        1266 and 1273, the Summa was conceived by Aquinas as an instructional guide for teachers and
                        novices and a compendium of all the approved teachings of the Catholic Church. It synthesizes an
                        astonishing range of scholarship, covering hundreds of topics and containing more than a million
                        and a half words―and was still unfinished at the time of Aquinas's death.</p><br>

                    <p class="books-description" style="height: 166px; overflow-y: scroll;">Who Was Jacques Derrida? is
                        the first intellectual biography of Derrida, the first full-scale appraisal of his career, his
                        influence, and his philosophical roots. It is also the first attempt to define his crucial
                        importance as the ambassador of theory, the phenomenon that has had a profound influence on
                        academic life in the humanities. Mikics lucidly and sensitively describes for the general reader
                        Derrida's deep connection to his Jewish roots. He succinctly defines his vision of philosophy as
                        a discipline that resists psychology. While pointing out the flaws of that vision and Derrida's
                        betrayal of his most adamantly expounded beliefs, Mikics ultimately concludes that Derrida was
                        neither so brilliantly right nor so badly wrong as his enthusiasts and critics, respectively,
                        claimed.</p><br>

                        active in a ministry that has lasted for fifty years and has spanned the globe. No stranger to
                        controversy, he still follows the call from God that he received as a young man. Taking readers
                        through his childhood, his marriage, the birth and growth of his children, and his various
                        ministries up to the present day. Oral Roberts shows what can be accomplished when a man commits
                        himself to obeying God - no matter what the cost. This is an inspiring autobiography for those
                        who have followed Dr. Robert's ministry through the years.</p><br>

                        insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough. By picking one newly discovered
                        gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of
                        our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine. From
                        Huntington's disease to cancer, from the applications of gene therapy to the horrors of
                        eugenics, Matt Ridley probes the scientific, philosophical, and moral issues arising as a result
                        of the mapping of the genome. It will help you understand what this scientific milestone means

                        Marks had 43 aliases, 89 phone lines, and owned 25 companies throughout the world. Whether bars,
                        recording studios, or offshore banks, all were money laundering vehicles serving the core
                        activity: dope dealing. Marks began to deal small amounts of hashish while doing a postgraduate
                        philosophy course at Oxford, but soon he was moving much larger quantities. At the height of his
                        career he was smuggling consignments of up to 50 tons from Pakistan and Thailand to America and
                        Canada and had contact with organizations as diverse as MI6, the CIA, the IRA, and the Mafia.

                        universe known as Satan reveals himself in this faux autobiography where we learn about that
                        voice within all of us that creates chaos in our lives and the world by interjecting doubt and
                        cynicism. They say that the greatest trick 'the Devil' ever pulled was convincing us that he
                        doesn't exist. In this book, Yehuda Berg uses the device of an 'as told to' autobiography to
                        explain the concept of The Adversary which plays a major role in Kabbalistic wisdom. We learn
                        that Satan resides within everyone, manifesting as a recurrent little voice of uncertainty and
                        negativity, and that is how havoc is wreaked throughout the world. By doing the spiritual work
                        that Kabbalah teaches, we can banish doubt and evil influences from our lives, and eliminate
                        chaos from the world. Although author Berg takes creative license with the narrative, he
                        presents a truthful representation of Kabbalah's view on the force of evil in the physical
                        universe.</p><br>

                        Mahatma Gandhi, and Richard Nixon. It also paints a rich and moving portrait of a people, a
                        time, and a nation in the face of powerful change. Finally, it shows how everyday Americans from
                        all walks of life confronted themselves, each other, and the burden of the past-and how their
                        fears and courage helped shape our future.</p><br>
