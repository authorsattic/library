                        doesn't remember anything before waking up on a school bus holding hands with a girl. Apparently
                        she's his girlfriend Piper, his best friend is a kid named Leo, and they're all students in the
                        Wilderness School, a boarding school for 'bad kids.' What he did to end up here, Jason has no
                        idea—except that everything seems very wrong.</p><br>

                        awoke after his long sleep, he didn't know much more than his name. His brain-fuzz is lingering,
                        even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight. Somehow Percy
                        managed to make it to the camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he had to continually kill
                        monsters that, annoyingly, would not stay dead. But the camp doesn't ring any bells with him.
                        Hazel is supposed to be dead. When she lived before, she didn't do a very good job of it. When
                        the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her 'gift' for an evil purpose, Hazel
                        couldn't say no. Now, because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk.</p><br>

                    <p class="books-description" style="height: 166px; overflow-y: scroll;">In The Son of Neptune,
                        Percy, Hazel, and Frank met in Camp Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Camp Halfblood, and
                        traveled to the land beyond the gods to complete a dangerous quest. The third book in the Heroes
                        of Olympus series will unite them with Jason, Piper, and Leo. But they number only six--who will
                        complete the Prophecy of Seven? The Greek and Roman demigods will have to cooperate in order to
                        defeat the giants released by the Earth Mother, Gaea. Then they will have to sail together to
                        the ancient land to find the Doors of Death. What exactly are the Doors of Death? Much of the
                        prophecy remains a mystery. . . . With old friends and new friends joining forces, a marvelous
                        ship, fearsome foes, and an exotic setting, The Mark of Athena promises to be another
                        unforgettable adventure by master storyteller Rick Riordan.</p><br>

                        Mark of Athena, Annabeth and Percy tumble into a pit leading straight to the Underworld. The
                        other five demigods have to put aside their grief and follow Percy's instructions to find the
                        mortal side of the Doors of Death. If they can fight their way through the Gaea's forces, and
                        Percy and Annabeth can survive the House of Hades, then the Seven will be able to seal the Doors
                        from both sides and prevent the giants from raising Gaea. But, Leo wonders, if the Doors are
                        sealed, how will Percy and Annabeth be able to escape? They have no choice. If the demigods
                        don't succeed, Gaea's armies will never die. They have no time. In about a month, the Romans
                        will march on Camp Half-Blood. The stakes are higher than ever in this adventure that dives into
                        the depths of Tartarus.</p><br>

                    <p class="books-description" style="height: 166px; overflow-y: scroll;">Though the Greek and Roman
                        crewmembers of the Argo II have made progress in their many quests, they still seem no closer to
                        defeating the earth mother, Gaea. Her giants have risen—all of them, and they're stronger than
                        ever. They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods
                        sacrificed in Athens. She needs their blood—the blood of Olympus—in order to wake. The demigods
                        are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp Half-Blood. The Roman legion from
                        Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost within striking distance. Though it is tempting to take
                        the Athena Parthenos to Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue
                        belongs back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the two camps. The
                        Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east. The gods, still suffering from multiple
                        personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of young demigods hope to persevere against
                        Gaea's army of powerful giants? As dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other
                        option. They have sacrificed too much already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over.</p><br>
