                    dangerous cavefly, which causes him to fall into an instant, deep sleep! To cure him, Geronimo and
                    Thea must seek out the petals of the pink stinkrose, a rare and smelly flower. But it only grows on
                    a very high peak! Can they make it there without going extinct on the way?</p><br>

                    Mouse City! It's a total cat-astrophe! Not only because mammoths are valuable allies of the
                    cavemice, but also because without them, the cavemice can't make mammoth milkshakes, their delicious
                    national drink. Geronimo Stiltonoot must embark on a daring journey to find the mammoths...and avoid
                    going extinct before he gets back!</p><br>
