                        (IPE) encompasses the intersection of politics and economics as goods, services, money, people,
                        and ideas move across borders. ... The liberal tradition of IPE also has historical antecedents,
                        beginning with classical political economy. This books show us all information about it in a
                        correct way.</p><br>

                        institutions is among the founding pillars of political science. With the rise of the 'new
                        institutionalism', the study of institutions has returned to its place in the sun. This volume
                        provides a comprehensive survey of where we are in the study of political institutions, covering
                        both the traditional concerns of political science with constitutions, federalism and
                        bureaucracy and more recent interest in theory and the constructed nature of institutions. The
                        Oxford Handbook of Political Institutions draws together a galaxy of distinguished contributors
                        drawn from leading universities across the world. Authoritative reviews of the literature and
                        assessments of future research directions will help to set the research agenda for the next
                        decade.</p><br>

                        the local people to solve the local problems. This system implies that the management of local
                        affairs should be entrusted to the representatives of the people inhabiting the locality; for
                        they know best the local needs and aspirations. In 1992, keeping this in view, the 7 4rh
                        Constitutional Amendment Act for urban local governance was v,pt'ed for on the floor of
                        Parliament in India. Based on this, the urban affairs have been administered in all the states
                        except in some parts of North-East India. This article is an attempt to study the working of

                        been won by the second most popular candidate, but these results were not inevitable. In fact,
                        such an unfair outcome need never happen again, and as William Poundstone shows in Gaming the
                        Vote, the solution is lurking right under our noses.</p><br>

                        answers that historians, philosophers, theologians, practising politicians and would-be
                        revolutionaries have given to one question:how should human beings best govern themselves? That
                        question raises innumerable others: can we manage our own affairs at all? Should we even try?
                        Many people in the past have thought that only some individuals were either able or entitled to
                        practise self-government: Greeks, but not Persians; men, but not women; the better-off minority,
                        but not the poor majority. Others have thought that few of us have any desire to govern
                        ourselves, and that government is inevitably a matter of a competent elite managing an
                        acquiescent mass.</p><br>

                        political philosophy as a means of resolution of that tension. Plato and Aristotle are examined
                        in order to see the search for the best political order. Inquiry is then made into political
                        philosophy's new tension brought about by the growth of revealed religion in the Middle Ages. It

                        thought. Plato's quest for absolute certainty led him to denounce political democracy, an
                        anti-political position later challenged by Aristotle. This back-and-forth exchange came to a
                        head at the time of the American and French revolutions. Through this wide-ranging narrative,
                        Dick Howard throws new light on a recurring philosophical dilemma, proving our political
                        problems are not as unique as we think.</p><br>

                        approach to the old problem of the nature of individual liberty in ancient Athens. He draws
                        extensively on oratorical and epigraphical evidence from the late fourth century BC to analyse
                        the ways in which ideas about liberty were reconciled with ideas about obligation, and examines
                        how this reconciliation was negotiated, performed, and presented in the Athenian law-courts,
                        assembly, and through the inscriptional mode of publication. Using modern political theory as a
                        springboard, Liddel argues that the ancient Athenians held liberty to consist of the substantial
                        obligations (political, financial, and military) of citizenship.</p><br>

                        increasingly, as a philosophy able to inform, guide and shape public life. More recently, core
                        civic republican commitments have found expression in policy formulations and curricular
                        documents for civic education in a number of Western democratic nations. Centred on the teaching
                        of education for citizenship, these programmes of civic education have made use of civic
                        republican language, including that of civic obligations, the common good, civic virtue and
                        deliberative political structures.</p><br>

                        teachings and his pedagogy. Education law may seem to be an odd vehicle for considering Scalia’s
                        constitutional approach, but thinking about schools requires attention to political
                        fundamentals—freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, equality of opportunity, federalism,
                        and the proper role of the expert. Legal scholars, philosophers, and political scientists
                        provide both critiques and apologies for Scalia’s approach.</p><br>

                        in American political history is contentious not simply because of battles over meaning. Equally
                        important is precisely who participated in contests over meaning. Was it simply judges, or did
                        legislatures have a strong say? And what about the public's role in effecting constitutional
                        change? In The Civic Constitution, Elizabeth Beaumont focuses on the last category, and traces
                        the efforts of citizens to reinvent constitutional democracy during four crucial eras: the
                        revolutionaries of the 1770s</p><br>

                    <p class="books-description" style="height: 166px; overflow-y: scroll;">In The Gods, the State, and
                        the Individual, John Scheid confronts these and other challenges directly. If Roman religious
                        practice has long been dismissed as a cynical or naïve system of borrowed structures unmarked by
                        any true piety, Scheid contends that this is the result of a misplaced expectation that the
                        basis of religion lies in an individual's personal and revelatory relationship with his or her
                        god. He argues that when viewed in the light of secular history as opposed to Christian
                        theology, Roman religion emerges as a legitimate phenomenon in which rituals, both public and
                        private, enforced a sense of communal, civic, and state identity.</p><br>
