                        famous he is. That's because he's being raised by his miserable muggle aunt and uncle who are
                        terrified Harry will learn that he's really a wizard, just as his parents were. But everything

                        and hideous that summer that al Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School of
                        Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a
                        strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster
                        will strike. And strike it does. For in Harry s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and
                        horrors arise, including and outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit
                        named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley s
                        younger sister, Ginny. But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and
                        someone or something starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more
                        poisonous rival than ever? Could it possible be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told?
                        Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects... Harry Potter himself?</p><br>

                        Lord Voldemort, is on the run - and they say he is coming after Harry. In his first ever

                        most terrifying of all are the Dementors patrolling the school grounds, with their soul-sucking

                        children.While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest
                        son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present
                        fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes
                        from unexpected places.</p><br>
